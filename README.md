# imagetosound
transform images, get the pixel, transform to sound
## python libs
```shell
pip install opencv-python
pip install numpy
pip install python-osc
pip install glob
```
install [processing](https://processing.org/) and [pure data](https://puredata.info/downloads). \
you will need to install osc5 (external library) foe processing to process OSC messages. \
first run the processing file, pd patch and then the python file. 
make sure that you edit path for images in the python file and load a sample into the pd patch. \
the rest is up to you :)
